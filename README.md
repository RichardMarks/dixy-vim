# DIXY Syntax Support for VIM

Are you writing [DIXY](https://github.com/RichardMarks/dixy) assembly in VIM and want it to be highlighted appropriately? Well look no further, now you can!

## Installation

Copy the `dixy.vim` from the `syntax` and `ftdetect` directories into `~/.vim/syntax` and `~/.vim/ftdetect` respectively.
Create directories if they do not exist.
Run VIM and open any DIXY Assembly Source `.das` file and it should be highlighted appropriately.
